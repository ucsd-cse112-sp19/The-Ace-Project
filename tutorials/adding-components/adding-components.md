This document assumes you have a workspace set up, have a blank *index.html* file that includes Ace Web Components within a script tag. Check out our
<a href="tutorial-installing-ace.html">setup tutorial</a> for more details.

## Adding Your First Component

In this tutorial, you will add your first Ace Web Component to your site. Lets get started with a simple button. Just add the following line to the body of your HTML page:

```
<core-button>Hello, Button</core-button>
```

You should get a button that like the following:

<core-button>Hello, Button</core-button>

## Customizing your Component

Each Ace Component has many different attributes you can use to stylize your site. Modify the `<core-button>` tag you added earlier to the following:

```
<core-button type='danger' round>Cool Button!</core-button>
```

You should see the following result:

<core-button type='danger' round>Cool Button!</core-button>

## Going Beyond

As you can see, adding Ace Web Components is as simple as it gets. If you want to know more about individual components, take a look at the rest of our <a href='index.html'>documentation</a>.
